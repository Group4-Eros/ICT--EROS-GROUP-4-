	<p class="preview">These are the lessons we have learned from ict subject; Html, Css, The parts of url, Internet terms, and Search engines.</h1>
	<p class="introduction">Ict stands for Information and Communications Technology. It can vary widely depending on what specific ares you focused on.
		Generally, Ict education equips individuals with skills such as computer literacy, software applications, digital communication and so on and so forth.
		Ict can also foster critical thinking, adaptability, and creativity in utilizing technology to tackle various tasks and challenges. -Belista</p>
	<p class="body"> The things that I learned from ict subject is about html document, the purpose of html, and the CSS which is the Cascading Style Sheet.
		CSS helps HTML to be more appealing and organized, for example in can put a color to the html. It also has properties used to change the appearance of a 
		specific element on a web page. And lastly, I also learned the parts of URL or Web adress and the importance of selector and declaration. -Vergara
		In the subject ICT or Information and Communications Technology, I learned how to create html or hypertext markup language which is the basic scripting language 
		used by web browsers to render pages on the world wide web. I also learned about the CSS or cascading style sheet, is used to style and layout web pages 
		For example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations, and other decorative features. 
		And lastly I learned about different kinds of search engines, search engines are used to search documents, videos, and images and an example of that is the google. -Macasaet B.
		I have learned many things from ict. It includes the Html wchich stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Css that stands for Cascading Style Sheet. The internet terms, and search engines.
		But there;s one thing that I really understood easily and more interesting for me, the parts of url. Url stands for Uniform Resource Locator, also referred to as a web adress.
		It's a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the internet. It has 9 parts. Firstly, scheme, tells web servers which protocol to use. Secondly, domain name, 
		a unique reference that identifies a website, it has 3 parts. The subdomain, top-level domain, and second level domain. Thirdly, port, it is a number and is rarely visible in url.
		Fourth, file path, a directory on the web server. Fifth, parameter string, helps you filter and organize content. It begins with a question mark. And lastly, anchor, it takes you
		to a specific place on page. It begins with a hashtag. -Alejandro
		I learned so many internet terms which are the vocabulary and terminology used to describe various internet-related concepts, technologies, and components. 
		These terms help us understand and communicate about various aspects of the online world. -Llada
		I have learned that there are more other search engines aside from what we are always using and it also has logos that are rarely seen. And as I learned different types and other examples 
		of search engine, it looks so interesting so I would like to try some of them to know how they are working and what can see in those search engines. -Aurinto
		I learned how to make a document, a website, and how to make it more appealing and interesting to open or read by the internet users. I also learned the parts of url, internet terms,
		and other search engines that I can use to help the ecosystem and other companies. -Abarquez
		I also learned the components of ICT, includes hardware (like computers, servers, and networking equipment), software (like operating systems, applications, and communication tools), 
		and services (like internet connectivity and cloud computing). The Applications of ICT that is widely used in various fields such as education, healthcare, finance, business, and government. 
		And it enables online learning, telemedicine, e-commerce, and e-governance. -Natanuan
	<p class="conclusion">We learned a lot of things about the lessons taught to us in ICT. As teenagers who's in a new generation and lived in a modern world, we need to be responsible and always think 
		before we click because every move can affect someone's life. We discover facts about the social world, but we also discovered things about ourselves. We found out the real reasons behind why 
		we use and why we donâ€™t use certain social networking sites especially those that are private, it's for our safety. We are thankful to our Tle/Ict teacher, Ms. Analiza Sadili for teaching us many
		things about lessons in this subject and also what we should and shouldn't do in when it comes in using internet, as a person and teenager.-Raymundo and the other members from Group 4</p>
